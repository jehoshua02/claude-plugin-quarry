# Quarry

Task management workflow. Capture, break, refine, prioritize, execute.

## Folders

- `project/0-inbox/` — quick capture. Just enough to not forget.
- `project/1-todo/` — prioritized and ready to pick up
- `project/2-doing/` — in progress
- `project/3-done/` — completed

Files in `1-todo/` are named with zero-padded priority score prefix: `012-dockerignore.md`, `045-comments.md`, etc.

## Prioritization

**Formula:**

```
Score = (Wv*(10-V)/9 + Wm*(10-M)/9 + We*(E-1)/9 + Wr*(R-1)/9) / (Wv + Wm + We + Wr) * S + 1
```

| Constant | Definition                                                                |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **V**    | Value (1-10). Impact, urgency, unblocking other work, validating assumptions. |
| **M**    | Momentum (1-10). Work already in progress. Finishing > starting. Tasks in an active slice (epic with completed tasks) score higher. |
| **E**    | Effort (1-10). Time and complexity to implement.                          |
| **R**    | Risk (1-10). Potential to break things, irreversibility, locking in bad decisions. |
| **Wv**   | Weight for Value. Max points Value can contribute.                        |
| **Wm**   | Weight for Momentum. Max points Momentum can contribute.                  |
| **We**   | Weight for Effort. Max points Effort can contribute.                      |
| **Wr**   | Weight for Risk. Max points Risk can contribute.                          |
| **S**    | Scale. Controls the score range (1 to S+1).                              |

**Defaults:** Wv=10, Wm=10, We=10, Wr=10, S=100.

**Range:** 1 to 101. Lower is better. Ties broken by gut.

## Workflow

### 1. Capture

- New idea or action item → create a file in `project/0-inbox/`. At minimum a title and one sentence. Include whatever relevant detail is available at time of capture.
- Commit after capturing.

### 2. Refine

- Before selecting the next task, refine inbox items one by one.
- Q&A loop until Value, Effort, and Risk can each be scored with reasoning.
- Document key details and decisions from the Q&A loop in the task file.
- Suggest a priority score. User confirms.
- Move to `project/1-todo/` with the priority score prefix.
- Commit.

### 3. Pick up

- Check `project/2-doing/` first. Finish in-progress items before starting new ones.
- Refine all `project/0-inbox/` items before picking up new work.
- Pick from the top of `ls` in `project/1-todo/` (lowest score = highest priority). Break ties with gut.
- Move to `project/2-doing/`.

### 4. Complete

1. Prove it works. Run commands, observe output, confirm no errors. If claude can gather proof, claude does. Otherwise, ask user to gather proof. If it cannot be immediately proven, create a monitoring plan and schedule a follow-up.
2. Paste proof into the task file's Verification section: exact commands run and their output. No proof, no move.
3. Update task file: details and decisions.
4. Move task to `project/3-done/`.
5. Commit. Commit approval is the review gate — present work clearly at this point.
6. Verify working tree is clean.
7. Go to step 3 (Pick up).

### Other transitions

| From                  | To                    | When                                                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `project/0-inbox/`   | `project/3-done/`    | No longer relevant. Note why in the file, move to done.           |
| `project/1-todo/`    | `project/3-done/`    | No longer relevant. Note why in the file, move to done.           |
| `project/2-doing/`   | `project/1-todo/`    | Blocked, paused, or scope changed significantly.                  |

## Rules

- All work must be tied to a task file. Key details and decisions documented in the task file as they come up.
- Document new information and decisions in the task file during work, not just during refinement.
- New action items while doing a task → quick capture in `project/0-inbox/`, keep doing current task.
- New action items while not doing a task → refine and put in `project/1-todo/`.
- Only move task files using transitions defined above. No skipping stages.
- Priority scores must be confirmed with the user. Suggest scores, but do not apply without user feedback.
- When the next step is obvious from the workflow rules, just do it. Don't ask.
